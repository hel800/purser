# Purser

A keyboard-driven todo app that lives in the system tray. Built with Tauri 2, Svelte 5 and SQLite.

## Usage

| Shortcut | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Ctrl+Alt+N` | Quick-add popup (global) |
| `Ctrl+Alt+L` | Todo list popup above the tray/clock (global) |
| `Enter` | Quick-add: save · List: tick selected todo (moves it to Done) |
| `↑` / `↓` (or `j` / `k`) | Navigate the list |
| `E` or `F2` | Edit due date of the selected open todo (natural language, empty removes it) |
| `Tab` | Switch between Open and Done view |
| `Del` | Done view: delete permanently |
| `Esc` (or clicking elsewhere) | Dismiss popup |

Left-clicking the tray icon also opens the list; right-click shows a menu.

### Settings (tray menu → Settings)

- **Start with Windows** — toggles autostart (on by default after the first
  release-build launch; your choice sticks afterwards)
- **24-hour clock** — switches due-date display between 24 h and 12 h (AM/PM);
  stored in `settings.json` next to the database

### Quick-add syntax

One line, natural language — dates and topics are parsed as you type:

```
pay rent friday 5pm #finance
prepare demo tomorrow 9am #work
water plants
```

- Dates/times are parsed with [chrono-node](https://github.com/wanasit/chrono) (`friday 5pm`, `tomorrow`, `in 2 weeks`, `Aug 20`, …)
- `#word` becomes the todo's topic; the list groups by topic, ordered by due date

## Data

SQLite database in the app data directory
(`%APPDATA%\com.sschaefer.purser\purser.db` on Windows).

## Autostart

Release builds register themselves to start with Windows on first launch
(silently, via `--autostart`); afterwards the tray setting decides. Dev builds
never auto-enable it.

## Linux notes

Wayland compositors don't let applications grab global shortcuts, so on
GNOME/KDE Wayland the two hotkeys won't fire (X11 works). Instead, bind these
commands in your desktop environment's keyboard settings:

```
purser --quick-add     # open the quick-add popup
purser --toggle-list   # toggle the todo list
```

The app is single-instance: running these commands forwards the flag to the
running instance.

## Development

```
npm install
npm run tauri dev      # run with hot reload
npm run tauri build    # produce NSIS installer (Windows)
```

Requires Rust (MSVC toolchain on Windows) and Node.
